# Zomato Data Set Analysis & Visualization

# Content
The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment
of different types of restaurant at different places in Bengaluru, aggregate rating of each restaurant, Bengaluru
being one such city has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world.
With each day new restaurants opening the industry has’nt been saturated yet and the demand is increasing
day by day. What kind of a food is more popular in a locality. Do the entire locality loves vegetarian food.
If yes then is that locality populated by a particular sect of people for eg. Jain, Marwaris, Gujaratis who are
mostly vegetarian. These kind of analysis can be done using the data, by studying the factors such as

• Location of the restaurant

• Approx Price of food

• Theme based restaurant or not

• Which locality of that city serves that cuisines with maximum number of restaurants

• The needs of people who are striving to get the best cuisine of the neighborhood

• Is a particular neighborhood famous for its own kind of food.



The data is accurate to that available on the zomato website until 15 March 2019.
The data was scraped from Zomato in two phase. After going through the structure of the website I found that for each neighborhood there are 6-7 category of restaurants viz. Buffet, Cafes, Delivery, Desserts, Dine-out, Drinks & nightlife, Pubs and bars.

Phase I,

In Phase I of extraction only the URL, name and address of the restaurant were extracted which were visible on the front page. The URl's for each of the restaurants on the zomato were recorded in the csv file so that later the data can be extracted individually for each restaurant. This made the extraction process easier and reduced the extra load on my machine. The data for each neighborhood and each category can be found here

Phase II,

In Phase II the recorded data for each restaurant and each category was read and data for each restaurant was scraped individually. 15 variables were scraped in this phase. For each of the neighborhood and for each category their online_order, book_table, rate, votes, phone, location, rest_type, dish_liked, cuisines, approx_cost(for two people), reviews_list, menu_item was extracted. See section 5 for more details about the variables.
